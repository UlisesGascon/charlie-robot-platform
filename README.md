# About

HCR Mobile Robot Kit with additional electronic and controlled with Node.js

‚ù§Ô∏è Awesome Features:

- [x] Easy integration with Node.js üî•
- [x] Simplified way to extend and define hardware components üç∫
- [x] Great abstractions to control and group hardware components üéâ
- [x] Effective way to include modes that allow the inclusion of predefined behavior üì¶
- [ ] Easy to use and great test coverage without the need of the physical hardware üëæ


## Making off üí™ 

![CharlieBot and I in the homelab](.github/other/charliebot_and_ulisesgascon.jpg)

In 2015, I took on a project with a mission to educate others about robotics. After accumulating a wealth of knowledge and experience, I recently made the decision to compile it all into a repository and use the leftover hardware from other projects in my homelab to build an upgraded version of this robot.
